-- Create a temporary view for the ingested dataset
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW big_data_view
USING CSV
OPTIONS (
    path 'path_to_your_dataset.csv',
    header 'true',
    inferSchema 'true'
);

-- Perform data transformation
-- Example: Cleaning and filtering data
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW cleaned_data AS
SELECT *
FROM big_data_view
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Perform data aggregation
-- Example: Aggregating sales data by product category
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT product_category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM big_data_view
GROUP BY product_category;

-- Perform data analysis
-- Example: Identifying top-selling products
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW top_selling_products AS
SELECT product_name, SUM(sales_quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM big_data_view
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Performance optimization (if necessary)
-- Example: Adding indexes to improve query performance
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

-- Visualize analysis results (using external tools or libraries)
-- Example: Generate a bar chart of top-selling products
-- (Visualization code would depend on the tool or library used)

-- Documentation and Presentation
-- Document the project including setup instructions, code explanations, and analysis findings.
-- Prepare a presentation highlighting key aspects of the project, including challenges, solutions, and insights gained.
